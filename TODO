# ToDo+ — Publish to VS Code Marketplace

- [ ] Create VS Code Marketplace publisher (rulingAnts)
- [ ] Install vsce (`npm i -D @vscode/vsce` or use npx)
- [ ] Generate VS Marketplace PAT (Azure DevOps) and set `VSCE_PAT`
	- Create at https://dev.azure.com → User Settings → Personal Access Tokens → New Token
	- Scope: Marketplace → Publish; set an expiration you’re comfortable with
	- Copy the token and either run `npx @vscode/vsce login rulingAnts` or `export VSCE_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN`
- [ ] Verify package.json fields: `publisher`, `name`, `version`, `engines.vscode`, `categories`, `icon`, `license`, `repository`, `readme`
- [ ] Add README screenshots and short feature list
- [ ] Add CHANGELOG entry for each release
- [ ] Run `npx @vscode/vsce package` (sanity check)
- [ ] Publish pre-release: `npx @vscode/vsce publish --pre-release`
- [ ] Verify listing, install from Marketplace
- [ ] Plan stable release: bump version, draft notes, `npx @vscode/vsce publish`
- [ ] Optional: Add badges (Marketplace installs, version) to README

# Specific features/details to fix:
	-[ ] Fix the \caption code with the table paste/insert function. (\caption needs a type of table, not figure, and needs to be AFTER \begin{tabularx})
	-[ ] Fix the table paste/insert so that tables are not floating (but also have a floating option).
